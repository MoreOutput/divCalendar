# divCalendar
div based calendaring

I wrote this sometime in 2010 and never actually finished it. Generated a calendar made of divs with utilities to add and remove days/weeks easily. The divs themselves have classes that mimic SQL datetime by default. Putting it on GH -- going through some old code :P
